# Project Delivery Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes project delivery timelines, team performance, and client satisfaction levels. The analysis is based on simulated project data and involves various data visualizations to derive insights about project delays, bug fixing efficiency, and delivery quality.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the analysis using `python analysis.py`.
4. Run the dashboard using `streamlit run dashboard.py`.

## Data Generation

The project data is generated using `generate_data.py`, which simulates realistic project details including delays, team size, hours worked, and bugs found.

## Visualizations

- **Project Delays Histogram**: Shows the distribution of project delays.
- **Interactive Scatter Plot**: Visualizes team size vs. hours worked.

## Results

Key insights include:

- Average project delays.
- Bug fixing efficiency.
- Delivery quality trends.
